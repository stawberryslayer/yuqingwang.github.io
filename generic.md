Being a student athelete since 8 years old. This path has give me valuable traits of resilience, strive in chanllenging senarios and a determination to be my best self.

I enjoy sports. I enjoy plaing table tennis, tennis, flag football, and snowboarding in winter.

Investment in myself. From a adolescent suffering from disordered eating pattern, it is not until I read about a post by a nutrition professional I realize the lack of my insight about dietary and food, how can I know the need of my body, and how I can be energetic and strong by simply change my eating pattern. I also highly value education as a investment in myself, the fulfillment of learning something new and apply my knowledge in previously unresolveable questions pushes me forward. Through learning, I build myself with knowledge, communication skills, problem solving skills, and most importantly, my unique perspective and insight to everything around me.
